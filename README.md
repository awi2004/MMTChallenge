Make My Trip Problem Statement:
Given dataset contains a total of 17 columns labeled A-P, out of which A-O columns are the features and column P is the label. Column “id” specifies a unique number for every row.  
Your job is to build a machine learning model to predict column P using all or some of the feature columns.  
The submission should be a csv file stating id along with the predicted label. 
Please check sample_submissions.csv file and make sure that your submission file in exact same format. 
Please download the dataset from this link - http://hck.re/64FQ44 


Files Provided in Dataset -  
Following are the files that will be provided in the dataset - 
Train.csv  - This file contains all the above mentioned columns. You are expected to train your models on this file.
Test.csv  - This file contains all the above mentioned columns except “P” column. You have to predict this column for each records given in this file.
Sample_submission.csv  - This file consists of sample submissions. Your submission should be in exact same format.

Achieved 80% accuracy with my implementation.
